resources:
  # A list of GCP resources that are unique and specific to your pipeline.
  #
  # The currently supported resources are shown below. Use only the resources
  # needed by your pipeline, and delete the rest of the examples.
  #
  # We will keep adding to the list below to support more Google Cloud resources
  # over time. If a resource you need isn't supported, please file an issue on
  # the repository.

  - type: bigquery_table
    # A Google BigQuery table to store your data. Requires a `bigquery_dataset`
    # to be specified in the config (i.e. `dataset.yaml) for the dataset that
    # this pipeline belongs in.
    #
    # Required Properties:
    #   table_id
    table_id: iris

dag:
  # The DAG acronym stands for directed acyclic graph. This block represents
  # your data pipeline along with every property and configuration it needs to
  # onboard your data.
  initialize:
    dag_id: iris
    default_args:
      owner: "Google"

      # When set to True, keeps a task from getting triggered if the previous schedule for the task hasnâ€™t succeeded
      depends_on_past: False
      start_date: '2021-05-01'
    max_active_runs: 1
    schedule_interval: "@hourly"  # run once a week at Sunday 12am
    catchup: False
    default_view: graph

  tasks:
    # This is where you specify the tasks (a.k.a. processes) that your data
    # pipeline will run to onboard the data.
    #
    # As the examples below will show, every task must be represented by an
    # Airflow operator. The list of suported operators are listed in
    #
    #   scripts/dag_imports.json
    #
    # If an operator you need isn't supported, please file an issue on the
    # repository.
    #
    # Use the YAML list syntax in this block to specify every task for your
    # pipeline.
