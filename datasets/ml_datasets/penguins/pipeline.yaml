resources:
  # A list of GCP resources that are unique and specific to your pipeline.
  #
  # The currently supported resources are shown below. Use only the resources
  # needed by your pipeline, and delete the rest of the examples.
  #
  # We will keep adding to the list below to support more Google Cloud resources
  # over time. If a resource you need isn't supported, please file an issue on
  # the repository.

  - type: bigquery_table
    # A Google BigQuery table to store your data. Requires a `bigquery_dataset`
    # to be specified in the config (i.e. `dataset.yaml) for the dataset that
    # this pipeline belongs in.

    #   table_id

  # The DAG acronym stands for directed acyclic graph. This block represents
  # your data pipeline along with every property and configuration it needs to
  # onboard your data.
