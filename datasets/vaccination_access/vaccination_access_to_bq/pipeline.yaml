resources:
  # A list of GCP resources that are unique and specific to your pipeline.
  #
  # The currently supported resources are shown below. Use only the resources
  # needed by your pipeline, and delete the rest of the examples.
  #
  # We will keep adding to the list below to support more Google Cloud resources
  # over time. If a resource you need isn't supported, please file an issue on
  # the repository.

  - type: bigquery_table
    # A Google BigQuery table to store your data. Requires a `bigquery_dataset`
    # to be specified in the config (i.e. `dataset.yaml) for the dataset that
    # this pipeline belongs in.
    #
    # Required Properties:
    #   table_id
    table_id: facility_boundary_us_walk_15min

dag:
  # The DAG acronym stands for directed acyclic graph. This block represents
  # your data pipeline along with every property and configuration it needs to
  # onboard your data.

  tasks:
    # This is where you specify the tasks (a.k.a. processes) that your data

    # Airflow operator. The list of suported operators are listed in

    #
    # If an operator you need isn't supported, please file an issue on the
    # repository.

    # Use the YAML list syntax in this block to specify every task for your
    # pipeline.
