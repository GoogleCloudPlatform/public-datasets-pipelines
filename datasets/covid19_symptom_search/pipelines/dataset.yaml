dataset:
  name: covid19_symptom_search
  friendly_name: covid19_symptom_search
  description: The COVID-19 Search Trends symptoms dataset shows aggregated, anonymized trends in Google searches for a broad set of health symptoms, signs, and conditions. The dataset provides a daily or weekly time series for each region showing the relative volume of searches for each symptom.
               This dataset is intended to help researchers to better understand the impact of COVID-19. It shouldn’t be used for medical diagnostic, prognostic, or treatment purposes. It also isn’t intended to be used for guidance on personal travel plans.
               As of Dec. 15, 2020, the dataset was expanded to include trends for Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. This expanded data is available in new tables that provide data at country and two subregional levels.  We are now producing aggregate weekly values computed from the individual daily values. To account for the newly available weekly-from-daily data, we adopted a new scaling factor for all US symptoms reported in the weekly time series.  The method is described in the updated documentation linked below. We will not be updating existing state/county tables going forward.
               To learn more about the dataset, how we generate it and preserve privacy, read the dataset documentation  https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-public-data-symptom-search/COVID-19%20Search%20Trends%20symptoms%20dataset%20documentation%20.pdf
