# ===== NOTE =====
# This YAML config template is used to write DAGs that use Airflow 1.10 operators.
# You can keep using this template when deploying to an environment that uses Airflow 2,
# they will keep working due to backport compatibility.
#
# For tracking progress on the YAML config templates that use Airflow 2 operators, see

resources:
  # A list of GCP resources that are unique and specific to your pipeline.
  #
  # The currently supported resources are shown below. Use only the resources
  # needed by your pipeline, and delete the rest of the examples.
  #
  # We will keep adding to the list below to support more Google Cloud resources
  # over time. If a resource you need isn't supported, please file an issue on
  # the repository.

  - type: bigquery_table
    # A Google BigQuery table to store your data. Requires a `bigquery_dataset`
    # to be specified in the config (i.e. `dataset.yaml) for the dataset that
    # this pipeline belongs in.
    #
    # Required Properties:
    #   table_id
    table_id: PIPELINE_FOLDER_NAME

    # Optional Properties:
    # Description of the table
    description: "This is a table description."

    # Time-based partitioning configuration. There is no need for this property
    # if you have a relatively small dataset to host on a BigQuery table.
    time_partitioning:

      # The supported types are DAY, HOUR, MONTH, and YEAR, which will generate one partition per day, hour, month, and year, respectively.
      type: "DAY"

      # If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified.
      require_partition_filter: false

    # Specifies column names to use for data clustering. Up to four top-level columns are allowed, and should be specified in descending priority order.
    clustering:

        #
        # 3. In that subfolder, create a Dockerfile (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) and any scripts you need to process the data. Use the `COPY` command (https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) in your `Dockerfile` to include your scripts in the image.
